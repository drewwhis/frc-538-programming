      Goal:
       My name is NAME. I was born on MM/DD/YYYY.
       My address is 00000 STREET NAME, CITY, STATE ZIP.
       My favorite color is COLOR.
         But I also like OTHER_COLOR.

    /* 
      Requirements
        You cannot use periods in the print (other than sep or end).
        MM/DD/YYYY should be in its own print.
        00000 STREET NAME, CITY, STATE should be in its own print.
        There are a total of four lines.
        The fourth line starts with a tab. 
        You can only use one println.
