2. Enter all required information (use a memorable username and password).
3. Send your username (and real name) to [@drewwhis](https://github.com/drewwhis).

## Get Text Editor
1. Choose a text editor.  I recommend VS Code and will be using it. 
Some popular choices include:
    * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    * [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
    * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.6.html)
2. If your text editor supports extensions, install those needed for your language.
For example, VS Code supports the following extensions:
    * Java
    * C++
    * Python
