# Workshop 00
## Choose a language
The team has chosen to use LANGUAGE for FRC Robot Code.

## Sign up for GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub](https://www.github.com/join) to sign up for an account.
2. Enter all required information (use a memorable username and password).
3. Send your username (and real name) to [@drewwhis](https://github.com/drewwhis).

## Get Text Editor
1. Choose a text editor.  I recommend VS Code and will be using it. Some popular choices include:
    * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    * [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
    * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.6.html)

2. If your text editor supports extensions, install those needed for your language. For example, VS Code supports the following extensions:
    * Java
    * C++
    * Python

## Set up Development Environment
1. We'll have to make sure you have git installed. Git is a source control management tool that allows you to easily make changes, track them, and undo/redo them without majorly affecting your code until you're 100% sure you want to make the change.
    * Installed by default in macOS and Linux.
    * [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
2. Depending on the language we've chosen, there are different steps to follow.
    * LabView
      1. Install [LabView for FRC](http://www.ni.com/download/labview-for-frc-17.0/7185/en/).
