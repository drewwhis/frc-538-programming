# 1. Variables
# Now that you can print to the screen, you'll be able to see what 
#  the computer is doing with your program as it runs.

# For print, you supplied some data into the function immediately.
# But what if you want to put some data in your program to be used later?

# This is where variables come in.
# In math, a variable is an unknown or something whose value can change.
# In programming, a variable is a piece of memory that can hold information.

# Consider: x = 3
# In math, we say, "The variable x is equal to the value 3," or "x is 3."
# In programming, this sentence reads, "The variable x gets the value 3," or "3 is stored in x."

# When programming in Python, = does not mean "equals," it means assignment.
# For that reason, it is called the assignment operator.
# Whenever you see it, think of it as "I am putting the right value into the memory on the left."

# You can use variables with print.
# You can uncomment both lines or just one, but notice what happens if the first line stays commented.
# x = 3
# print(x)

# Generally, you want to name your variables something more meaningful than x.
# Variables should start with a lowercase letter and have no spaces.
# If you have multiple words in the variable, they should all start with a capital letter (except the first).
# This is called camelCase.
# myBetterNamedVariable = 42
